I'm currently building an app to help people nurture and strengthen their existing communities and relationships. This is a fullstack app being built using Express/Node and React.

Frontend Technologies Used:

React
React Context to pass states deeply
React Query to handle fetching, caching, etc. of data
Axios for API calls
Styled Components to smartly handle CSS of components with props
React Router for handling of all routing within app
LocalStorage for maintaining non-sensitive user states
Future: WebSockets for real-time sharing / updates
Figma for designing UX of the application and for ideating on the design system
